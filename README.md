# rust-starter

`rust-starter` is a barebones repository intended to be used as a foundation for creating new rust projects. It includes yaml configuration file management, logging, as well as a CLI with the bare necessities, and nothing else allowing for full customization. Minimal dependencies ensure that the template should be compatible with just about every rust project out there.
